# brave-news-source-suggestion

Pipeline for producing the source embedding representations and similarity matrix needed for source suggestion feature in Brave News.

## Scripts
Run the scripts in the order in which they are presented.

`source-feed-accumulator.py`: parses periodically Brave News's feed, creating articles buckets for each source. These buckets are collected in `articles_history.csv` and catalogued by the `publisher_id` attribute.

`sources-similarity-matrix.py`: takes in the source buckets and produces an 512-dimensional embedding for each source, built as the mean of the 512-dimensional embeddings of all articles belonging to the source, as generated by the Universal Sentence Encoder model (https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.11175).

## Outputs

`source_embeddings.csv`: [`index | publisher_id | 0 | 1 ... | ... 511`]  stores all the 512-dimensional embeddings for each source under its `publisher_name`.

`source_similarity_t10.json` stores the top-10 most similar sources, with similarity score, for each source.
