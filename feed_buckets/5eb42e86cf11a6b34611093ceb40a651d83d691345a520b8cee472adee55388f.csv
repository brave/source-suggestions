Let’s look at some pretty things for all of us. First off, #1 on this list is clearly gray hair. Let those sparklies grow in! I realize I missed the whole silver sisters grow-out culture that has been taking place by not photographing myself constantly but here I am, fully dye-free. (That hasn’t happened since I was 13!)

Let’s look at some gourmand fragrances that give off that vibe. Fall is here, let’s celebrate! Smell like a marshmallow! (Fun fact, I do not like eating marshmallows. But all of these, save one, have something more to them and that lets me forgive the fact that they remind me of the worst of confections.) Let’s just smell delicious.
