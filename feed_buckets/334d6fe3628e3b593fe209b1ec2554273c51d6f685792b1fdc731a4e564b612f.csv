"The Book of Kells — Christ Enthroned","Rick Steves' Travel Blog","For me, one of the great joys of travel is having in-person encounters with great art — which I’ve collected in a book called Europe’s Top 100 Masterpieces. Here’s one of my favorites: Jesus Christ sits on a throne and solemnly cradles something very important — a book, the holy word of God. He has … Continue reading The Book of Kells — Christ Enthroned","2021-10-16 02:51:34","Travel","https://blog.ricksteves.com/blog/book-of-kells-christ-enthroned/","334d6fe3628e3b593fe209b1ec2554273c51d6f685792b1fdc731a4e564b612f","18756882955605bfa0a38a373a14bd28"
"Siena: Italy’s Medieval Soul","Rick Steves' Travel Blog","I believe a regular dose of travel dreaming can be good for the soul. Stow away with me to Siena, Italy, in this excerpt from my book For the Love of Europe, a collection of 100 of my favorite places, people, and stories from a lifetime of European travels.  Stretched across a Tuscan hill, Siena … Continue reading Siena: Italy’s Medieval Soul","2021-09-04 19:20:19","Travel","https://blog.ricksteves.com/blog/siena-italys-medieval-soul/","334d6fe3628e3b593fe209b1ec2554273c51d6f685792b1fdc731a4e564b612f","42010f1e039f9a878e57d86156d9eb7d"
"The Best Hike of my Life: The Tour du Mont Blanc","Rick Steves' Travel Blog","Earlier this fall, four of us — total novices at long-distance treks — hiked around Europe’s highest mountain. (On the first day, big birds of prey circled high overhead. My hunch: They were vultures just waiting for one of us to drop.) The Tour du Mont Blanc is a 100-mile, ten-day hike — but we … Continue reading The Best Hike of my Life: The Tour du Mont Blanc","2021-11-10 05:06:10","Travel","https://blog.ricksteves.com/blog/tour-du-mont-blanc/","334d6fe3628e3b593fe209b1ec2554273c51d6f685792b1fdc731a4e564b612f","fc2bec84c3b93bba3d86b12031f48b55"
"The Mont Blanc Esprit de Corps","Rick Steves' Travel Blog","  Hiking Europe’s Tour du Mont Blanc was a totally different slice of European culture for me: Coming upon a remote farmhouse-turned-thriving-cafe serving wonderful lunches…flowers and cows (with classic bells) scenically sprinkled throughout…and an esprit de corps where everyone is like family.   As nearly everyone hikes in the same direction (counter-clockwise), you become friends … Continue reading The Mont Blanc Esprit de Corps","2021-11-11 02:52:17","Travel","https://blog.ricksteves.com/blog/mont-blanc-esprit-de-corps/","334d6fe3628e3b593fe209b1ec2554273c51d6f685792b1fdc731a4e564b612f","0cb54c217901fb0b38af07e0a7f44a26"
"The Tour du Mont Blanc: Some Tips I Learned Along the Way","Rick Steves' Travel Blog","  At 66, I felt a bit like the father of the hiking community when I hiked around Mont Blanc earlier this fall. But the Tour du Mont Blanc is doable for any reasonably fit hiker, and there were plenty of people on the trail who were older than me. For total novices like Shelley … Continue reading The Tour du Mont Blanc: Some Tips I Learned Along the Way","2021-11-15 01:59:13","Travel","https://blog.ricksteves.com/blog/tour-du-mont-blanc-tips/","334d6fe3628e3b593fe209b1ec2554273c51d6f685792b1fdc731a4e564b612f","341fae936cc8313d9e4a6d1c09466c49"
"Taking it Easy on the Tour du Mont Blanc","Rick Steves' Travel Blog","While the Tour du Mont Blanc is demanding, it’s not a particularly difficult hike. It’s just long, with lots of altitude gain and loss, and always scenic. On my recent trek around the mountain with three friends, it seemed each of us had a weak spot: knees, toes, or lungs. For some, the challenge was … Continue reading Taking it Easy on the Tour du Mont Blanc","2021-11-13 02:56:52","Travel","https://blog.ricksteves.com/blog/taking-it-easy-on-the-tmb/","334d6fe3628e3b593fe209b1ec2554273c51d6f685792b1fdc731a4e564b612f","d3e6acf50e541f707f62e110f1409163"
