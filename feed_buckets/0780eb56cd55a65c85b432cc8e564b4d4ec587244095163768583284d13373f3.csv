"Pacific rockfish and the trade-offs of a long life","ScienceDaily","Pacific rockfish are among the longest-lived vertebrates -- some species live 200+ years. Yet others live barely 10. Their varied lifespans make rockfish a unique genus in which to pinpoint genes associated with long lifespan. Biologists sequenced and compared the genomes of 88 species and found longevity-related genes involved in living at depth and growing larger, but also an increase in some types of regulatory genes. Longer life also correlates with decreased population sizes.","2021-11-11 20:42:21","Science","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/11/211111154221.htm","0780eb56cd55a65c85b432cc8e564b4d4ec587244095163768583284d13373f3","18d6222e41347361218be8285059a36d"
